                My story begins in 2010, when I was hired by U.S. Bank. I was one of the first people hired to begin work in a brand new department. Within a years' time the department had grown from 20 employees to 150. By year two it had grown to 400 employees. As the department grew so did its reporting needs and I was given the job of building these reports.

                It just so happened I had no idea what I was doing but I was excited to meet the challenge. So I took courses to expand my knowledge of microsoft excel and Access databases. I used this knowledge to build databases for every purpose from reporting to workflow to payroll. For a long time these processes were enough, but that time, like all things, came to an end.

                <p>
                In late 2015 our humble reporting team was swallowed up by the company wide reporting team. Where we were laughed at for building reports in Access databases like cavemen. After a healthy amount of ridicule we were told there was a better way, and all we had to do was accept structured query language as our personal lord and savior. So from that day I was baptised into programming and given the title of business analyst.

                In the interest of full disclosure, I was a high school dropout and it had been over a decade since I had done that, so to say I was nervous about my job depending on my ability to learn this new skill is an understatement. And yet I took to it rather well, I really surprised myself.  In fact before too long I had learned how to (via the miracle of code) automate nearly every process, I was responsible for. It was at this point I was laid off.
